    -   title: O que é a Hedy?
        text: "Hedy é uma linguagem de programação textual, desenvolvida especificamente para (pré-)adolescentes (10 a 15 anos).\nEm contraste com linguagens de programação para crianças, como Scratch, Hedy não usa blocos de código, mas código textual.\nEntão com a Hedy você aprenderá a digitar código como os programadores de verdade fazem, mas em pequenos passos com exercícios lúdicos.\nDesta forma a Hedy pode funcionar como um trampolim para linguagens de programação reais como Python de uma forma acessível e principalmente divertida!\nAqui você pode assistir a um [vídeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) sobre o desenvolvimento da Hedy como linguagem de programação.\n"
    -   title: Público-alvo
        text: "Hedy foi desenvolvida com alunos do ensino fundamental e médio em mente (de 10 a 15 anos).\nÉ importante que os alunos saibam ler bem. Recomendamos não começar com a Hedy antes que os alunos tenham alcançado pelo menos um nível de leitura do 3º Ano do Ensino Fundamental.\nAlunos (e professores!) não precisam de nenhuma experiência em programação antes de começar com a Hedy.\n"

    -   title: Ensinando com a Hedy
        text: "Hedy é dividida em níveis, nos quais novos comandos são ensinados. Cada nível contém uma variedade de aventuras para praticar os comandos recém-aprendidos.\nComo professor, você decide quais aventuras estão disponíveis para seus alunos. Eles vão fazer um restaurante, uma calculadora ou uma casa mal-assombrada neste nível? Dentro de cada nível, as aventuras são organizadas da mais fácil à mais difícil.\nAssim, seus alunos continuam sendo desafiados. As aventuras podem ser feitas pelos alunos individualmente, ou você pode usá-las em uma instrução tradicional.\n\nAs aventuras também incluem um exemplo de código, para garantir que os professores menos informados digitalmente também possam usar a Hedy!\nÉ claro que a Hedy também atende aos professores criativos que adoram fazer seus próprios planos de aula e aventuras!\n\nDepois de programar todas as aventuras de um determinado nível, seus alunos podem testar seus conhecimentos no questionário.\nVocê pode acompanhar o trabalho de seus alunos e o progresso deles na página da turma.\n"
    -   title: Dispositivos
        text: "A Hedy é baseado na web, o que significa que funciona em qualquer dispositivo com navegador (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.), portanto, laptops, chromebooks, tablets e até smartphones são adequados para usar a Hedy.\nNão há necessidade de baixar nada antes de trabalhar com a Hedy, basta acessar o site e pronto!\n"

        text: "When students create profile they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.\nChanging this language can always be done later on by navigation to 'My profile' and 'My profile' again.\nFrom December 2021 on setting a preferred language is obligatory for each Hedy account.\nWhen your account or the accounts of your students have being created earlier than this date you will receive a message that a preferred language is missing.\nDon't worry!

You can also choose which language the keywords (for example 'print' or 'ask') should be in.\nThis way you can teach your students to code with English keywords, but you can also let them program in their own laguage. For example Dutch students can use the command 'vraag' instead of 'ask'.\n"

    subsections:
    -   text: "Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.\nThis gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.\nWe use this structure in our lessons:\n"
        title: ' '
    -   title: Introduction
        text: "You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?\nThis way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you strat introducing the new lesson.\n"
    -   title: Introduction of new concepts and commands
        text: "The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.\nThat's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.\nEspecially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience whith programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.\nShowing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog').\n"
    -   title: Let's get to work
        text: "Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.\nThe following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.\nThe adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.\nThe last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.\nThey don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.\nThe example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.\nStimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.\n"
    -   title: Quiz
        text: "To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them make the quiz.\nThe quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.\nNot every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.\n"
    -   title: Evaluation
        text: "Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?\nHow did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?\nStudents are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and gove your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.\n"

                error_code: "forward 300\nturn 90\n"
                solution_text: "In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.\n"

                solution_text: "Use a varible instead.\n"
                error_text: "For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!\n"

                solution_text: "This is the correct code:\n"
                solution_code: "print('my name is Hedy!')\n"
        -   title: Students will still use the ask command
            example:
                error_text: "The ask command has been used since level 1. So it might be hard for the students to switch to input instead of ask.\n"
                error_code: "print('My name is Hedy!')\nname = ask('What is your name?')\nprint('So your name is ', name)\n"
                solution_text: "This is the correct code:\n"
                solution_code: "print('My name is Hedy!')\nname = input('What is your name?')\nprint('So your name is ', name)\n"
        -   title: Students might use the brackets as quotation marks
            example:
                error_text: "They have learned to keep the variables outside of the quotation marks, so they might do the same with the brackets. Which is not the correct way to use them.\n"
                error_code: "temperature = 25\nprint('It is ') temperature ('degrees outside')\n"
                solution_text: "This is the correct code:\n"
                solution_code: "temperature = 25\nprint('It is ', temperature, 'degrees outside')\n"
    title: Frequently made mistakes
    key: common_mistakes
    intro: "You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!\nMaking mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!\nEspecially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.\n"

-   title: "O que é uma linguagem de programação gradual?"
    text: |
        Aprender a programar pode ser difícil. Não que a programação em si *seja* difícil! Mas existem muitas regras que você precisa memorizar, assim como quando você começou a aprender Português.
        Da mesma forma, você precisará de muita prática para aprender programação.

        Você pode ler estas frases com facilidade. Mas você se lembra de quando estava aprendendo a ler? Você demorou para ler cada letra!
        Isso também é verdade para a programação, pode ser difícil no começo, mas ficará mais fácil!

        O bom da Hedy é que a Hedy é *gradual*. Isso significa que você não precisa aprender todas as regras de uma vez.
        Os primeiros níveis não têm muitas regras, então você pode se acostumar com a programação devagarinho.
        Em cada nível, adicionamos novas regras, aumentando o número de comandos que você conhece. Os comandos são instruções para um computador.
-   title: "Por que Hedy é gradual?"
    text: |
        Neste vídeo, Felienne, a criadora da Hedy, explica o porquê de Hedy ser gradual.

        <iframe width="560" height="315" class="mx-auto mt-4" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fmF7HpU_-9k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
-   title: "Para quem é a Hedy?"
    text: |
        Hedy foi feito para todas as crianças que desejam aprender programação! Você precisa saber ler português com facilidade.
-   title: "Preciso de experiência em programação?"
    text: |
        Não, isso não é necessário. No entanto, se você programou com Scratch ou Python, alguns comandos parecerão familiares para você.
-   title: "A Hedy é gratuito?"
    text: |
        Sim! A Universidade de Leiden nos permite compartilhá-la gratuitamente.
        Hedy também é 'código aberto', o que significa que todos que podem programar podem nos ajudar a torná-lo melhor. Você pode encontrar o código no [GitHub] (https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy).
        Se você gosta de Hedy, adoraríamos uma [doação](https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg?locale=en)!
-   title: "Preciso instalar alguma coisa?"
    text: |-
        Não. Hedy funciona no navegador, que é o programa que você está usando para ver esta página. Provavelmente Chrome, Edge ou Firefox. Hedy também funciona em seu telefone ou tablet.

        text: |
            A Hedy egy szöveges programozási nyelv, amelyet kifejezetten (fiatal) tizenévesek (10-15 évesek) számára fejlesztettek ki.
            A gyerekek programozási nyelveivel ellentétben, mint a Scratch, Hedy nem kódblokkokat, hanem szöveges kódokat használ.
            Tehát Hedy segítségével a diákok megtanulhatják, hogyan kell olyat kódot írni, mint amilyet az igazi programozók, de apró lépésekben játékos gyakorlatokkal.
            Így Hedy lépcsőfokként szolgálhat a valódi programozási nyelvekhez, mint például a Python, elérhető és többnyire szórakoztató módon!
            Itt látható egy [videó](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdqT313rM40&amp;t=2s) a Hedy mint programozási nyelv fejlődéséről.
    -   title: "Célközönség"
        text: |
            A Hedy-t a felső tagozatos és középiskolás diákok szem előtt tartásával fejlesztették ki (10-15 évesek).
            Fontos, hogy a diákok jól tudjanak olvasni. Javasoljuk, hogy ne kezdj Hedy-vel tanítani, mielőtt a diákok nem érték el legalább a 3. osztály olvasási szintjét.
            A diákoknak (és a tanároknak) nincs szükségük programozási tapasztalatokra, mielőtt Hedy -vel kezdenének dolgozni.

        text: |
            Hedy szintekre van osztva, amelyek új parancsokat tanítanak. Minden szint különféle gyakorlatokat tartalmaz az újonnan tanult parancsok gyakorlására.
            A gyakorlatokat a diákok egyénileg is elvégezhetik, vagy használhatják hagyományos óravezetéssel. Az egyes szintek óraterveit ez a tanári kézikönyv tartalmazza.
            Az óraterveket és gyakorlatokat lépésről lépésre ismertetjük, hogy a kevésbé digitálisan tájékozott tanárok is tudják használni a Hedyt!
            Természetesen Hedy gondoskodik a kreatív tanárokról is, akik szeretnek saját óraterveket és gyakorlatokat készíteni!
    -   title: "Eszközök"
        text: |
            A Hedy webalapú, ami azt jelenti, hogy bármilyen böngészővel rendelkező eszközön (Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge stb.) működik, így laptopok, chromebookok, táblagépek és még okostelefonok is alkalmasak a Hedy használatára.
            Nem kell semmit letölteni, mielőtt Hedyvel dolgozol, csak menj a webhelyre, és készen áll!

            You can also customize your class and choose which adventures are available for them. This way your students won't be overwhelmed by the amount of adventures and levels, and they can specifically focus on the adventures you'd like them to practice with.
            This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qva9gXBoUwY&t=10s) shows you how to customize your class.
    -   title: Setting preferred language
        text: "When students create profile they are supposed to choose a 'preferred language'. Hedy will always be loaded in this selected language.\nChanging this language can always be done later on by navigation to 'My account' and 'My personal settings' again.\nFrom December 2021 on setting a preferred language is obligatory for each Hedy account.\nWhen your account or the accounts of your students have being created earlier than this date you will receive a message that a preferred language is missing.\nDon't worry! Navigate to 'My profile' and set a language in your profile settings.\nUntil you set a language Hedy will be shown in your browser language and, when this language is not supported, in English.\n\n**For non-English speakers**\nNot only can you change the language of the adventures to your own language. You can also choose which language the keywords (for example 'print' or 'ask') should be in.\nThis way you can teach your students to code with English keywords, but you can also let them program in their own laguage. For example Dutch students can use the command 'vraag' instead of 'ask'.\n"

        text: |
            Hedy contains a lot of different levels that each teach a different new skill. We recommend to teach one level per lesson.
            This gives your students the time to fully grasp a new command or concept and practice with it, before moving on to the next level.
            We use this structure in our lessons:
    -   title: "Introduction"
        text: |
            You can start your lessons by activating your students' prior knowledge: What do they already know about the subject, what did they learn in the previous lesson and which mistakes did they make that they've now learned from?
            This way all the previously learned commands and frequently made mistakes are fresh in your students' memories, when you strat introducing the new lesson.
    -   title: "Introduction of new concepts and commands"
        text: |
            The new concepts and commands can be very hard for some students to fully understand.
            That's why it's of importance to model the proper use of the new commands to your students.
            Especially in the lower levels, where some students have no experience whith programming at all, it can be hard for them to understand the new abstract concepts.
            Showing a lot of examples makes an abstract concept (for instance: 'What is a variable?') more recognizable and easier to understand ('Look, the variable pet changed into dog').
    -   title: "Let's get to work"
        text: |
            Each level contains different adventures that you can find in the pink tabs. The first pink tab explains the new commands in this level.
            The following tabs are adventures that the students can try out and make their own.
            The adventures are arranged from easiest to hardest, so we recommend to start on the left and your your way to the right.
            The last tab 'what's next' gives a little teaser of what you'll learn in the next level. Of course, you can select the adventures you want your students to do for each level.
            They don't always have to make every adventure. Every adventure contains an example code, that the students can try out with the green button.
            The example code gets copied to the workfield, where the students can try out the code and adjust it to make it their own.
            Stimulate your students to turn the example codes into their own projects by adding their own ideas and making their own variation of the adventure.
    -   title: "Quiz"
        text: |
            To test whether your students have picked up all the new info in the level, you can let them make the quiz.
            The quiz contains 10 multiple choice questions about the new concepts and command to that level.
            Not every level has a quiz yet, as we are still building the quizzes.
    -   title: "Evaluation"
        text: |
            Round up your lesson by having a brief evaluation. What did the students learn? Which hardships did they come across?
            How did they learn from their mistakes? And of course: What did they create?
            Students are often very proud of their own creations, so it's nice to save a little time and gove your students the opportunity to show their work to their classmates.

            Is your (student's) code not working? There must be a bug (coding mistake) in it! You can use the debugger to find the mistake.
            The debugger is the ladybig button in your coding screen. If you press it, you can run your code line by line to find your mistake.
            Have you found the mistake? Press the red stop button and the debugger will shut off.
    -   title: "Read aloud"
        text: |
            Do you want the output of your program to be read aloud? Then you can use the read aloud function that is found under the 'run code' button in your coding screen.
    -   title: "Programmers mode"

-   title: "Frequently made mistakes"
    key: "common_mistakes"
    intro: |
        You can learn from your mistakes, especially in coding!
        Making mistakes is unavoidable, and a great opportunity to learn, but for teachers it can be a challenge to find the correct fix for a mistake!
        Especially as the codes get longer and longer as the levels progress. That's why we've made a list with frequently made mistakes in each level, and their solutions.
    levels:
    -   level: '1'
        sections:
        -   title: "Students forget to type commandos"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For example they type a sentence without using print.
                error_code: |
                    Hedy can't print this
                solution_text: |
                    Teach your students to always start a line of code with a command.
                solution_code: |
                    print Hedy can print this!
        -   title: "Students use capitals when typing commands"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Commands won't work if they are in capitals.
                error_code: |
                    Ask Why does my code fail?
                    Print Because I'm using capitals.
                solution_text: |
                    Remove the capitals.
                solution_code: |
                    ask Why does my code work now?
                    print Because I removed the capitals!
        -   title: "Students use echo without ask"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Echo is made to repeat an answer after an ask command. Without ask echo won't do anything.
                error_code: |
                    echo Your name is
                solution_text: |
                    Add an ask command to make it work.
                solution_code: |
                    ask What's your name?
                    echo Your name is
        -   title: "Students want their echo word (variable) to be in the middle of a sentence"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    And they are right! That's why they will learn to use proper variables in the next level.
                error_code: |
                    ask Which programming language is the most fun?
                    echo is the best!
                solution_text: |
                    In level 1 we have to keep it at this:
                solution_code: |
                    ask Which programming language is the most fun?
                    echo The best is...
        -   title: "Turtle: Students let the turtle walk off of the screen"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Often students love to try out big numbers when using the turtle, which causes the arrow to walk off the screen.
                error_code: |
                    forward 300
                    turn 90
                solution_text: |
                    In the example. students tend to think that the turn command doesn't work. Eventhough is does work, but you can't see it happening off screen. Use smaller numbers to prevent this from happening.
                solution_code: |
                    forward 100
                    turn 90
        -   title: "Turtle: Students use the command backward, but that doens't exist"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Backward is not a command.
                error_code: |
                    backward 100
                solution_text: |
                    To make the turtle go backwards, you use the forward command and a negative number. For example:
                solution_code: |
                    forward -100
    -   level: '2'
        sections:
        -   title: "Students make typos in their commands"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    Hedy can't recognize a command with a typo.
                error_code: |
                    prinnt Don't make typos!
                solution_text: |
                    Teach your students to read the error messages. This way they can find out themselves what went wrong.
                solution_code: |
                    print Don't make typos!
        -   title: "Students forget that the ask command has changed"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this level students learn about variables. The ask command requires a variable as well, but students forget this.
                error_code: |
                    ask what would you like to eat?
                solution_text: |
                    In this level you have to tell Hedy where to save your answer, so it can be used later on. This is called a variable.
                solution_code: |
                    order is What would you like to eat?
        -   title: "Students try to use the echo command. "
            example:
                error_text: |
                    For some students it might be frustrating to learn that the echo command doesn't work anymore. That's why it's very important to explain the advantages of using variables. For example you can use multiple variables in a code, and you can put them anywhere you like in a sentence!
                error_code: |
                    answer is ask Why doesn't echo work anymore?!
                    echo
                solution_text: |
                    Use a varible instead.
                solution_code: |
                    answer is ask Why doens't echo work anymore?!
                    print answer
        -   title: "Students use a variable name or as a normal word"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In the example below the word 'name' is used a a variable, but also as a normal text. The output of this code will be 'Hi my Hedy is Hedy'.
                error_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi my name is name
                solution_text: |
                    So don't use a word you want to use in the text as a variable name. In level 4 this is solved with quotation marks.
                solution_code: |
                    name is Hedy
                    print Hi I'm name
        -   title: "Students use long variable names containing two words."
            example:
                error_text: |
                    A variable should be named with one word. You could use an underscore to connect two words. That counts as one.
                error_code: |
                    chosen door is ask Which door do you pick?
                solution_text: |
                    Add an underscore.
                solution_code: |
                    chosen_door is ask which door do you pick?
        -   title: "Students might use two different names for the same variable"
            example:
                error_text: |
                    In this example the student has used 'horse' and 'name' for the same variables.
                error_code: |
                    horse is ask What is your horse called?
                    print Your horse is called name
                solution_text: |
                    Always check wheter the variable has the same name throughout the code. Slight differences can be hard to spot (for example plurals) but they will interfere with the code.
                solution_code: |

                error_code: "repeat 3 times\n    drink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'\nprint drink\n"
                solution_text: "In the correct code the third line starts with indentation too. This way it belongs to the repeat block and therefore it will be repeated 3 times.\nShowing your students these differences can help them understand why we need indentation to make our programs work.\n"
                solution_code: "repeat 3 times\n    drink = ask 'What would you like to drink?'\n    print drink\n"
        -   title: Students want to nest if statements, or put if statements inside a loop
            example:
                error_text: "In this level students aren't allowed yet to put if statements inside other if statements or inside repeat loops.\nIn the next level this is allowed.\n"
                error_code: "birthday = ask 'Is it you birthday?'\nif birthday = yes\n    repeat 3 times\n        print 'Hip Hip Hooray!'\n"

        -   title: Students make programs that take too long to run
            example:
                error_text: "In this level it's very easy to make long codes. The students aren't allowed to make programs that take to long to load (to save our servers).\n"
                error_code: "repeat 100 times\n    print 'How many times can I repeat this?'\n"

                solution_code: "repeat 20 times\n    print 'This is enough'\n"
        -   title: Students use the if command to check if the variable value is the same as the variable name
            example:
                error_text: "We have seen this mistake by some of our students. They make a password for their computer, but they make the password 'password'.\nIn line 2 the computer is asked to check wheter the variable password is the same as the variable password, so itself. Which means the answer is alway yes.\nSo with this code the answer will always be 'You can come in' no matter what the player fills in.\n"
                error_code: "password is ask 'What is the password?'\nif password is password\n    print 'You can come in'\nelse\n    print 'You are not allowed'\n"
                solution_text: "You can fix this mistake by adding quotation marks. This way the computer knows that the second password in `if password is 'password'` is a string value (so normal text) and not the variable name.\n"
                solution_code: "password is ask 'What is the password?'\nif password is 'password'\n    print 'You can come in'\nelse\n    print 'You are not allowed'\n"

-   title: "Textual programming made easy!"
    text: |
        Many schools and teachers around the world want to teach their students programming. Initially this is often done with playful tools, ranging from the Beebot robot to
        Scratch Junior or Scratch. After using such tools, kids often want to move to more powerful, textual programming languages, like Python.

        Python however is hard, because it is only available in English, and requires learners to learn complex programming concepts and syntax at once.
        Hedy is the easy way to get started with textual programming languages! Hedy is free to use, open source, and unlike any other textual programming language in three ways.

        1. Hedy is multi-lingual, you can use Hedy in your own language
        2. Hedy is gradual, so you can learn one concept and its syntax a time
        3. Hedy is built for the classroom, allowing teachers to fully customize their student's experience
-   title: "Multi-lingual programming"
    text: |
        While almost all textual programming language have keywords in English, such as `for` or `repeat`, Hedy can be used in any language! We currently support 39 different languages, including Spanish, Arabic, Simplified Chinese and Hindi. If your language is not available you can always start a a new translation.
-   title: "Step by step learning"
    text: |
        Learning a programming language can be overwhelming, since learners have to learn concepts (for example if-else or loops) and syntax (like quotation marks or round brackets) at the same time. In Hedy, concepts are first introduced with little syntax and then refined. A scientifically proven way to learn!
-   title: "Built for the classroom"
    text: |
        Hedy is suitable for kids aged 10 and up and designed for classroom use.
        Teachers can use our free, built-in lesson plans, but can also author their own lessons and load these into the Hedy user interface.
-   title: "Programming in context"
    text: |
        Hedy shows programming in the broadest way possible, and can be used in variety of exciting ways. Hedy allows for the creation of digital and interactive stories, colorful drawings that can be shown on the screen but also drawn with a pen plotter or embroidered on a shirt, and can be used to create games or apps with buttons and keyboard actions.
-   title: "Is Hedy free?"
    text: |
        Yes! Hedy is 'Open source', which means that everyone can help us make Hedy better.
        You can find our code on [GitHub](https://github.com/hedyorg/hedy).
        If you like Hedy and want to contribute, we accept (and are very grateful for) [donations](https://github.com/sponsors/hedyorg)!

-   title: "Do I need to install anything?"
    text: |-
        No. Hedy works in the browser, which is the program you are using to look at this page. Probably Chrome or Edge or Firefox. Hedy also works on phones and tablets.
-   title: "Do I need programming experience to teach with Hedy?"
    text: |-
        No, that is not needed. All concepts are explained in the slides and in the interface for learners.
        If you create a free teacher's account, you also get access to the teacher's manual with information on how to teach
        and frequently made mistakes.

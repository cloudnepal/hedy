                with `{print}`, `{ask}` and `{echo}` you can already create a little story.
                This is a good time to try the Parrot, Story and Rock, Paper Scissors adventures.

                We can also set a variable by asking questions.

                The answer to the question is stored in the variable.

                This way we don't need the `{echo}`  command.

            text: Now that we use variables, we can use multiple variables instead of just one `{echo}`command.

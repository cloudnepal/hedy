                As you could see in the previous example. If you use the `{ask}` command, you can ask a question.

                The answer, however doesn't show in the output screen.

                If you do want the answer to show, you can use the final command of this level: `{echo}`.

                `{echo}` is used to repeat the answer of an `{ask}`.

                We can also set a variable by asking questions.

                The answer to the question is stored in the variable.

                This way we don't need the `{echo}`  command.
        4:
            text: Now that we use variables, we can use multiple variables instead of just one `{echo}`command.

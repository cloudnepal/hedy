The code you have created here can be copied to real Python environments like replit or PyCharm, and you can continue learning there! Note however that Python can only read English commands, so if you have been using other languages, you will need to switch to English now.

That means we need to use parentheses with print and range from now on.\n\nAlso, if you want to print more than one item, you need to separate them by commas.\n\nThe final change we will need to make to get Python code is changing ask into input.\n\nClick on the 'print' tab for all the examples."

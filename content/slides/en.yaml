            Programming is giving instructions to a computer, using the language of the computer.

            Such a language is called a "programming language".

            If you can program, you can do many cool things:
            * Build interactive stories
            * Create computer drawings and draw these on paper or fabric
            * Build your own apps to use on your phone

          text: |
               We will start level 1 by making stories in Hedy!

               We need three text codes to create interactive stories.

          header: "Hedy level 1: {print}"
          text: |
              The first code that you can use in level 1 is `{print}`.

            text: |
              The second code that you can use in level 1 is `{ask}`.

            text: |
              With `{print`, `{ask}` and `{echo}` you can already create a little story.
              This is a good time to try the Parrot, Story and Rock, Paper Scissors adventures.

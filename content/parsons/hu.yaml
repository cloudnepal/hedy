                Help this family out by creating a schedule of who is cooking and what they should be making this week. The remove commands make sure nobody has to cook twice and they have a differnet dinner every day.
                **Mind!** the variable order should be first days, then people, and lastly dinner_options. This goes for the lines with the remove commands too.
